## Project Details

This was my first Project that takes lots of time to develop. It is because learning is process that involves many forward and backward steps and i certainly love to go backwards...
I use MVVM architecture design pattern to make this app. Also use Alamofire for networking.
The app has three main views

Firstly splashscreen shows up when you open it i have made this splash art with animation because i thought that it might be look cooler.

This is the main page of my app. It displays allcharacters button, location buttons, and the characters who stays on this buttons. I can say that making this buttons takes so much afford.
For example for allcharacters button. I had to take all the characters which are stays on 42 pages and i made it with one for loop and an array so i could not think this easily :D.
For a location buttons i had to take what user tapped which index so i can list my characters with this index with a call on api.

This is the last screen and it shows the details of characters.
I can say this wasn't hard.
